## What is Large Language Model?
Language model in simple words is a type of Machine Learning models that can perform a variety of NLP tasks such as generating and classifying text, translation and Q&A.
With a main goal which is to assign probablities to a sentece.

The term **large** refers to the number of parameters that model has.

LLMs are trained with huge amount of data and use self-supervised learning to predict the next token in a sentence, given the surrounding context,
this process is repeated until the model reaches an acceptable level of accuracy.

## Applications
1. Text Generation
2. Machine Translation
3. Summarization
4. Q&A, dialogue bots, etc.....

## Types of Language Models?
## **1. Statistical Language Modeling:**

Statistical LM is the development of probabilistic models that predict the next word in a sentece given the words the precede it.
